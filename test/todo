1. improve error reporting with 'Status' exception + Consumer<Exception> checkException

2. improve try/finally locking semantics with MutexLock 

3. clean up unused (option) fields in DbMain
   review DbMain open/get/put/delete/write codepaths; mark TODO's
   look into usint MutexLock for 'mutex'

4. review Version/VersionSet

5. convert class destructors to close() methods

6. review file life cycle -> open/close in constructor/desctructor 

7. convert DbMain.mutex to MutexLock() to reflect use of 'MutexLock l(&mutex_);'

     * Note: because the Block cursor userKey points to a mutable workarea
     *       the final user of the MergingIterator getKey() must do a Struct.copy(key)
